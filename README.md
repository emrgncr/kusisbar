Clicking on the Koç Üniversitesi logo on the top left returns you to the main KUSIS page. 
The navigation bar <i>should</i> appear and work in every KUSIS page.
The main buttons themselves are not clickable but hovering on them will create clickable new buttons.

The addon is tested on Firefox, Opera and Chrome.

## Installation

To install, you can either clone this repository (or download it as a zip) and add the addon to your browser as a folder, or download a signed and compressed file from [releases](https://github.com/emrgncr/kusisbar/releases) and add to your browser that way.

After a successfull installation, the addon should work in the background when a KUSIS tab is open.
